# Simon Says Game

A simple brain-challenging game where you need to remember and repeat the blinking sequence of colors. The game tests your memory and attention as you progress through the levels.

## Game Description

The game consists of four color cards. Each level, one new random card blinks, and you must remember the entire sequence from the start. The challenge grows as the sequence gets longer with each new level.

- **Level 1:** One card blinks.
- **Level 2:** A second random card blinks, but you must recall and repeat the sequence starting from the first card.
- **Level 3:** A third random card is added to the sequence, and you must recall and repeat the full sequence.
- And so on...

Your task is to remember the entire sequence and click the cards in the correct order. Each time you successfully complete a sequence, a new random card is added, increasing the difficulty.
